  <Title>Automatic Fishing in Toon Estate</Title>
  <Description>
The Toon will automatically fish in your estate.
Before you click on Start, make sure that
• your fish bucket is empty,
• you have enough JellyBeans for 20 casts,
• your toon is standing on the board nearest to the bucket
Note: Doodles may cause the simulator to fail.
